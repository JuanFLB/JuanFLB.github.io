Currently, Iâ€™m doing a postdoc in Copenhagen where I focus on researching liver cancer.\nAlthough I have spent most of my career in the wet-lab, Iâ€™ve always been interested in bioinformatics and graphic design. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m excited to launch my personal website! It will be my portfolio to showcase my skills as a scientific illustrator and my learning process in R for bioinformatics. Iâ€™m looking forward to share my creative side with the world and explore new career paths. Come along with me on this journey!"
