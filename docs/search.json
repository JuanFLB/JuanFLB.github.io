Currently, I‚Äôm doing a postdoc in Copenhagen where I focus on researching liver cancer.\nAlthough I have spent most of my career in the wet-lab, I‚Äôve always been interested in bioinformatics and graphic design. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm excited to launch my personal website! It will be my portfolio to showcase my skills as a scientific illustrator and my learning process in R for bioinformatics. I‚Äôm looking forward to share my creative side with the world and explore new career paths. Come along with me on this journey!"
