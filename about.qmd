ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Juan! I have a background in Biotechnology and a PhD in Molecular Biology and Biomedicine. Currently, I'm doing a postdoc in Copenhagen where I focus on researching liver cancer.  
Although I have spent most of my career in the wet-lab, I've always been interested in bioinformatics and graphic design. That's why I'm excited to launch my personal website! It will be my portfolio to showcase my skills as a scientific illustrator and my learning process in R for bioinformatics. I'm looking forward to share my creative side with the world and explore new career paths. Come along with me on this journey!
